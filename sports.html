                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p class="sportsp">MANILA, Philippines (AP) — Boxing
                        legend Manny Pacquiao is officially hanging up his
                        gloves.

                        The eight-division world champion and Philippine senator on Wednesday announced his
                        retirement
                        from the ring.

                        “I would like to thank the whole world, especially the Filipino people, for supporting Manny
                        Pacquiao. Goodbye boxing,”
                        the 42-year-old said in a video posted on his Facebook page. “It is difficult for me to
                        accept
                        that my time as a boxer
                        is over. Today I am announcing my retirement.”

                        Pacquiao finished his 26-year, 72-fight career with 62 wins, eight losses and two draws. Of
                        those 62 wins, 39 were by
                        knockout and 23 by decision. He won 12 world titles and is the only fighter in history to
                        win
                        titles in eight different
                        weight classes.

                        His retirement from boxing followed a disheartening defeat to Yordenis Ugas in Paradise,
                        Nevada,
                        on Aug. 21. The younger
                        Cuban boxer beat Pacquiao by unanimous decision, retaining his WBA welterweight title. It
                        was
                        Pacquiao’s first fight in
                        more than two years.
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        “Thank you for changing my life. When my family was desperate, you gave us hope, you gave me
                        the
                        chance to fight my way
                        out of poverty,” Pacquiao said in the video. “Because of you, I was able to inspire people
                        all
                        over
                        the world. Because
                        of you I have been given the courage to change more lives.”

                        Pacquaio had hinted at retirement recently. It had also been expected because he is setting
                        his

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        sights on a bigger
                        political battlefield. Earlier this month, he accepted his political party’s nomination and
                        declared
                        he will run for
                        Philippines president in elections next May.

                        He has accused the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, his former ally, of making
                        corruption worse in the
                        Philippines. He promised to fight poverty and warned corrupt politicians they will soon end
                        up
                        in
                        jail.

                        Pacquiao’s rags-to-riches life story and legendary career brought honor to his Southeast
                        Asian
                        nation, where he is known
                        by the monikers Pacman, People’s Champ and National Fist.

                        He left his impoverished home in the southern Philippines as a teenager and stowed away on a
                        ship
                        bound for Manila. He
                        made his professional boxing debut as a junior flyweight in 1995 at the age of 16, fighting
                        his
                        way
                        out of abject
                        poverty to become one of the world’s highest-paid athletes.

                        Eddie Banaag, a 79-year-old retiree, said Pacquiao was his idol as a boxer and he watched
                        almost
                        all
                        of his fights. But
                        he believes the boxing icon should have retired earlier.

                        “He should have done that right after his victory over (Keith) Thurman,” Banaag said of
                        Pacquiao’s
                        win over Thurman on
                        July 20, 2019, in Las Vegas, Pacquiao’s second-to-last fight. “It would have been better if
                        he
                        ended
                        his boxing career
                        with a win rather than a loss.”

                        Still, Pacquiao believes he will always be remembered as a winner. Hundreds of millions of
                        dollars
                        in career earnings
                        and his record in the ring leave no doubt.

                        “I will never forget what I have done and accomplished in my life,” Pacquiao said Wednesday.
                        “I
                        just
                        heard the final
                        bell. The boxing is over.“

                    <p class="sportsp">
                        It's official – Team Spirit are the Dota 2 World Champions. The Russian squad lifted the Aegis
                        of Champions at The
                        International 10 after defeating PSG.LGD 3-2. But just how did this Cinderella story come to
                        fruition?
                        It seems hard to believe now that Team Spirit nearly didn't even make it to The International 10
                        after failing to secure
                        enough Dota Pro Circuit points during the regular season. The team then found themselves down
                        2-1 in the finals of the
                        open qualifiers, just one game away from never making it. Now they’re the champions.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="h22">A false start</h2>
                    <p class="sportsp">The event did not get off to a great start for Team Spirit as they struggled to
                        find their feet
                        and ended the first day
                        of the Group Stage 0-2, losing to both Vici Gaming and Team Secret, both of whom they went on to
                        knockout during their
                        lower bracket run. However, Spirit eventually turned it around and managed to get into the upper
                        bracket, with a score
                        of 10-6.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">After losing 1-2 in the first round of the upper bracket to Invictus Gaming,
                        Spirit's chances of
                        success looked slim.
                        Being in the lower bracket meant playing many more games, and one bad day could spell the end of
                        the campaign. But
                        Team
                        Spirit were undeterred.
                        Round three of the lower bracket was when they met their first real test as they matched up
                        against defending
                        champions
                        OG. However, Spirit quickly dispatched them in a 2-0 series showing that they were not afraid of
                        the big stage.
                        Next up was fellow Eastern European team Virtus.Pro, who have spent the year beating Team Spirit
                        in the Dota Pro
                        Circuit. It was a close series that required all three games, but Spirit came out on top,
                        winning 2-1. The
                        nail-biting
                        third game was nearly the end of Team Spirit, with the squad only claiming an advantage of more
                        than 3k gold in the
                        35th
                        minute. However, during a fight gone wrong, Team Spirit lost 8k gold, and Virtus.Pro reduced the
                        lead to 4k.
                        Spirit then faced IG, who originally sent them to the lower bracket.

                    <p class="sportsp">
                        However,
                        Team Spirit ended up beating them 2-0, and
                        then for a place in the Grand Finals, they had to face Team Secret, who they also lost to on the
                        first day of the Group Stage.

                        The Grand Finals were a complete whirlwind of emotions. Team Spirit started it off by taking two
                        games against PSG.LGD,
                        and it looked like they were on another level compared to their opponents. However, LGD, not
                        wanting to lose another
                        final, turned things around and delivered a 2-0 to tie the series 2-2.
                        The fourth game of the event was a complete out-draft by PSG.LGD. Team Spirit ended the game
                        with just two kills, with
                        the match only lasting 25 minutes. It was the quickest of the series so far, and heading into
                        the fifth game, momentum
                        was firmly in PSG.LGD's favour.
                        Spirit showed their confidence, allowing LGD to pick their favourite combination of Tiny and
                        Lycan, which terrorised
                        teams during the event. Despite this, Team Spirit managed to take the Aegis and, in the most
                        unlikely story, claimed the
                        first win at The International for Eastern Europe since Natus Vincere lifted the prize at the
                        first International back
                        in 2011. How fitting that on the 10th anniversary, it returns to the region that started it all.

                    <p class="sportsp">“It’s early.”

                        Everything written about the league’s 30 teams after two or three games could include those two
                        words, though the author
                        doesn’t know if they go before or after the “but.” For instance, should it be…

                        “It’s early, but the Timberwolves have the league’s No. 1 defense.”

                        Or …

                        “The Timberwolves have the league’s No. 1 defense, but it’s early.”

                        In time, the Wolves will let us know which was the appropriate syntax. After Week 1 last season,
                        the league’s top five
                        defenses were those of the Brooklyn Nets, Cleveland Cavaliers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Phoenix
                        Suns and New Orleans
                        Pelicans. The Suns finished the season at No. 6, but those other four teams all finished in the
                        bottom nine defensively.
                    </p>

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p class="sportsp">So the Nets had the league’s No. 1 defense, but it was early. And not the other

                        Of course, every game that was played in Week 1 counts every bit as much as any game that will
                        be played in February or
                        March. Sample sizes are small and proper context is always needed, but it’s never too early to
                        start mining the data and
                        studying the film. History tells us that the standings after 20 games closely resemble the
                        standings at the end of the
                        season, and after Week 2, we’ll be about a third of the way to that 20-game mark.

                        It’s early, but the teams must be ranked every Monday. So, with the Milwaukee Bucks losing their
                        second game by …
                        [checks notes] … 42 points, they’re no longer in the top spot. And it’s three undefeated Western
                        Conference squads that
                        lead the way into Week 2.
