                    <p class="sportsp">
                        MANILA, Philippines — Sexy actress AJ Raval revealed the real score between her and actor Aljur
                        Abrenica, who recently
                        broke up with wife Kylie Padilla.

                        During PEP.ph’s “On The Spot Challenge,” AJ admitted that Aljur is courting her.

                        “Yes, totoo. Hindi ako magpapakaipokrita. 'Di na ako magsisinungaling, 'di na ako magde-deny,
                        kasi mukha lang kaming
                        tanga kapag nag-deny kami. Well, totoo naman na nag-uusap kami,” AJ said.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        Nag-uusap kami. We understand each other. We care for each other. Pero wala pa kami sa point na
                        may relasyon kami.
                        Parang getting to know…” she said.

                        It can be recalled that AJ said in her YouTube channel with Donnalyn Bartolome that she has a
                        suitor at the moment.

                        “'Yung nag-iisa na 'yun, ramdam na ramdam ko talaga na special ako,” AJ told Donnalyn.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../WEBINAR/pictures/showbizimage2.jpg.crdownload" class="S4">
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        “Hindi ko pa alam, pero na-appreciate ko siya. Pero 'di pa lang siguro ako ready rin pumasok sa
                        relationship kasi
                        kakagaling ko lang sa relationship,” she added.

                        Romantic rumors between AJ and Aljur began when Aljur posted a shirtless photo of him in a place
                        which social media
                        users believed to be at AJ’s home.

                        AJ and Aljur co-star in the Viva Film movie “Nerissa.”

                        Kylie revealed that she and Aljur mutually agreed to date other people.

                        In her Twitter account, Kylie said there is no issue if ever rumors are true that Aljur is
                        dating Viva artist AJ Raval.

                        “Guys there is no issue. We separated April pa and we have already mutually agreed to date other
                        people,” she said.

                        “Please stop dragging other parties into this. I have no intention of disclosing anymore of what
                        happened because I want
                        to cherish the littlest ounce of privacy I have left,” she added.

                    </h2>
                    <img src="../WEBINAR/pictures/showbizimage3.jpg" class="S4">
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        MANILA, Philippines — Kapuso star Kylie Padilla reminded her ex-husband Aljur Abrenica and
                        his rumored new girlfriend AJ
                        Raval to be careful because although Kylie and Aljur agreed to date other people, their
                        marriage is still not annulled.

                        During her interview with Jessica Soho on “Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho” yesterday, Kylie
                        admitted that she and Aljur are
                        still married – on paper – so Aljur should be careful in flaunting his new romance in
                        public.
                        “I actually wanted to talk to her (AJ),” Kylie told Jessica when asked for reaction to AJ’s
                        apology for reposting
                        Aljur’s Facebook post that claimed that it was Kylie who cheated first and wrecked their
                        family.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        “Napagdaanan ko rin ‘yan na binabash ako dahil nililigawan ako. And I wanted to talk to her to
                        help her out on how to
                        handle it. Para lang maiwasan lang ‘yung nangyari ngayon. But my help’s not being asked, so I’ll
                        not give it na lang.”

                        She said she can relate with AJ when the sexy star claimed that the “mistress” allegations have
                        been affecting AJ’s
                        mental health.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        “I totally understand kung doon sila nanggagaling. S’ya ‘yung bagong nililigawan eh, nababash na
                        sila. I’ve been on that
                        side and I know how scary and confusing and sobrang nakakasira s’ya ng mental health eh, ‘di ba?
                        But I wish na iningatan
                        na lang nila,” Kylie said.
                        Kylie, however, wished that Aljur and AJ would not point at her for the bashing that they are
                        getting.

                        “They can’t blame me for that, too. Because we both had an agreement eh that we can both see
                        other people. I wish you
                        guys were more careful. Don’t blame it on me.”

                        Like her, Kylie also understands that it is also unfair for AJ to be branded as “mistress.” But
                        since Aljur and AJ chose
                        to be in the situation they are in, they should know how to deal with it, Kylie said.

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        MANILA -- Less than a week after she made a big splash as one of the celebrity housemates of
                        "Pinoy Big Brother
                        Kumunity” Season 10, viral online seller Daisy Lopez, popularly known as Madam Inutz, released a
                        Christmas music video
                        "Sangkap ng Pasko."
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        The carol embodies Madam Inutz’s “hard knocks” life and how she copes with the love and support
                        of her family.
                        Particularly poignant is the video showing her and her mother who’s bedridden now for five
                        years.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        Composed by Ryan Soto with music direction by Edrex Sanchez, “Sangkap ng Pasko” was recorded by
                        Madam Inutz before she
                        entered the "PBB" house. It’s a follow-up to her debut single “Inutil” released on her YouTube
                        platform.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        “Promise, iiyak kayo sa song na ito. Sobrang mata-touch ang mga Pinoy," Lopez’s manager Wilbert
                        Tolentino told ABS-CBN
                        News. “Makakare-relate sila na ang sangkap o ingredient ng Pasko ay ang pagmamahal ng pamilya,
                        no matter what they're
                        going through.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        Madam Inutz recently struck an emotional chord with viewers at a recent "PBB" episode where she
                        was surprised by a
                        letter from her family that came with a symbol of her love for her ailing mother -- an adult
                        diaper.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        “Alam namin 'di mo kami susukuan," a crying Madam Inutz read her sister’s letter.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        She later told her co-housemates of her mission, no matter the cost. “Basta 'pag family, never
                        ako napagod, kahit na
                        sabihing ang bigat ng sakripisyo. Iisa lang kasi ang magulang, dapat tulungan. Mag-isa ko siyang
                        pinapagamot,
                        tinataguyod.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        Madam Inutz rose to social media fame for her inimitable style of live online selling, combining
                        cuss words with humor
                        and sexy dancing that clicked with netizens. It was the former OFW’s way to raise money when
                        finances dried up during
                        the pandemic.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        Shortly before she entered the "PBB" bubble last October 6, Madam Inutz also got an unexpected
                        present from Tolentino --
                        a raw 88-sq.m. house and lot in Bulacan with a 55 sq.m. floor area.

                        “Dream ko talaga ito," said Madam Inutz who was reduced to tears as she was escorted into the
                        house.

                        “Huwag ka na umiyak. Deserved mo ‘yan, deserved mo ito,” said Tolentino who shared the moment on
                        his social media
                        platform.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        According to Tolentino, it was also a “motivational gift for Madam Inutz so that she will focus
                        on her work and push
                        herself to do her best inside the 'PBB' house.”
