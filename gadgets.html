                        Two new Realme devices are just around the corner. In addition to the Realme GT Master Edition
                        (our unboxing video is
                        up), the Realme Book has also been confirmed for the local market, with the official launch date
                        set for September 23.

                        Realme Philippines will bring the 11th Gen Intel Core i3 and Core i5 variants of its first
                        laptop, and both are equipped
                        with Iris Xe graphics, 8GB RAM, and up to 512GB of PCIe SSD storage. They will be available in
                        Real Silver and Real Blue
                        colors.

                        Local pricing will be announced during the launch, but expect aggressive price tags attached to
                        both models. In India,
                        where the laptop debuted last month as the Realme Book Slim, the base Core i3 variant costs
                        ₹46,999, which translates to
                        roughly $640 or P31,920.

                        Despite copying Apple's design elements, the realme Book does have solid specs for the price.
                        First, it has a 512GB SSD
                        drive. If you're getting a MacBook, you need to spend almost P70,000 to get the variant with
                        that amount of fast SSD
                        storage.

                        The Realme Book uses an aluminium-alloy unibody design sporting a mirror logo. It’s only 15.5mm
                        thick and weighs 1.38
                        kilograms. Impressively, the company’s first laptop features a 14-inch IPS display with a 2,160
                        x 1,440 resolution, 100%
                        sRGB color gamut, and a tall 3:2 aspect ratio.

                    <p class="sportsp">The Realme Book offers 400 nits of peak brightness, making it brighter than most
                        notebooks in its
                        class. Its thin
                        bezels, meanwhile, bolsters its screen-to-body ratio to 90% — more than the 82% screen-to-body
                        ratio of Apple’s MacBook
                        Air.

                        When it comes to multimedia features, the Book promises to deliver immersive stereo sound
                        courtesy of two Harman Kardon
                        speakers that also incorporate DTS audio technology. It likewise has two internal microphones
                        that use noise-cancelling
                        algorithms to block out background sound that might disrupt your video calls.

                        Connectivity options on the Realme Book include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C
                        port, a USB-A 3.1 Gen 1
                        port, and a standard audio jack. The Core i5 model adds a Thunderbolt 4 port for connectivity as
                        well as charging.

                        Under the hood, both variants pack a 54Wh battery that is rated to deliver up to 11 hours of
                        battery life on a single
                        charge. It supports 65-watt fast charging, which is claimed to top up 50% of the built-in cell
                        after just 30 minutes
                        plugged in.</p>

                        AMD has been on a mission in recent years. With a string of successful releases, it's gone from
                        relative outsider to
                        Intel's primary rival in the CPU world.

                        But while many laptops offer a choice between Intel and AMD chips, it's a different story where
                        desktops are concerned.
                        PC enthusiasts buy standalone chips to upgrade their machines, so need to be convinced that it's
                        worth picking up over
                        the competition.

                        Despite significant stock shortages, the Ryzen 5000 series has been well received since
                        launching in November 2020. The
                        subsequent arrival of Intel's Rocket Lake chips has intensified the competition, with some
                        benchmarks putting the CPUs
                        neck-and-neck.

                        However, we're looking to head to what AMD has planned next. Here's everything you need to know
                        about what we assume
                        will be called the Ryzen 6000 series.

                    <h2 class="h22">When will the AMD Ryzen 6000 series be released?</h2>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        Nothing has been revealed at this early stage, so our best guess on the Ryzen 6000 release date
                        comes from when previous
                        generations were launched:

                        Ryzen 1000 Series - from March 2017
                        Ryzen 2000 Series - from April 2018
                        Ryzen 3000 Series - from July 2019
                        Ryzen 5000 Series - from November 2020
                        With that in mind, it's looking likely that Ryzen 6000 CPUs will be released in early 2022. WePC
                        is reporting on a
                        leaked roadmap which suggests it will be unveiled sometime that year.

                        The launch could potentially coincide with CES, which we'd expect to take place in January once
                        again.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="h22"> AMD Ryzen 6000 Series Features</h2>
                    <img src="../WEBINAR/pictures/gadgetimage9.jpg" class="S4">
                    <p class="sportsp">As AMD has not announced any features update about the AMD Ryzen 6000 Series,
                        there are a lot of assumptions going on in
                        the market about the features of the Ryzen 6000 series. Some of them are, that the AMD Ryzen
                        6000 Series might come to
                        know from the code name of Warhol and will have a 6nm chip with Zen 3+ architecture.</p>

                    <h2 class="h22">How much will the AMD Ryzen 6000 series cost?</h2>
                    <p class="sportsp">With no concrete rumours so far, we can again use the pricing of the Ryzen 5000
                        series as a
                        guide.

                        Ryzen 9 5950X - £735.84/US$799
                        Ryzen 9 5900X - £505.61US$549
                        Ryzen 7 5800X - £413.51/US$449
                        Ryzen 5 5600X - £275.36/US$299
                        That was a US$50 increase on its predecessor across the board, so there's a chance we'll see
                        similar price hikes for the
                        Ryzen 6000 Series. That's especially true if it makes the move to Zen 4 architecture.</p>
