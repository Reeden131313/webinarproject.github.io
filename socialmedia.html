                        1. Managing Privacy Settings
                        When a user uploads a video to YouTube, by default the video is set to public, which means
                        anyone can see the video.
                        Depending on the age of your child, you should discuss what settings are best to use if your
                        child is uploading footage
                        to YouTube. You can easily switch videos to private or unlisted (published on YouTube but cannot
                        be found without a
                        direct link to the video).

                        You can also invite people to view your videos using Google Circles. Please note, you need to
                        link your channel with
                        Google+ in order to share a private video with other users. Click here for info on how to
                        connect a YouTube channel to a
                        Google+ profile.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        2. Set up Parental Controls
                        Parents should set up age restrictions and parental controls on YouTube. See how to set up
                        parental controls.

                    <p class="sportsp">3. Disable Comments on YouTube
                        YouTube allows you to disable comments entirely on videos or users have the options to approve
                        each comment before they
                        are published, this can help avoid risks of experiencing cyberbullying. See how to disable
                        comments.

                    <p class="sportsp">
                        4. Use Safety Mode
                        YouTube has a Safety mode, a setting which gives users the opportunity to bar mature content. It
                        is an “opt-in” setting,
                        which means that it won’t take effect until you switch it on. The setting filters search results
                        to remove videos with
                        mature content or videos that have been age-restricted, meaning that such content will not show
                        up in video searches,
                        related videos, playlists, shows or movie sections. While no filtering system is 100 percent
                        accurate, we recommend that
                        parents of young children enable this feature.

                    <p class="sportsp">Twitter has posted its Q3 2021 performance numbers, showing steady increases
                        in both users
                        and revenue. But steady may
                        not be enough, given the platform’s ambitious growth targets, while its ongoing investment
                        into new projects doesn’t
                        appear to be paying off as it likely would have hoped.
                    </p>

                    <P class="sportsp">
                        Twitter kind of tries to obscure its data by reporting direct YoY comparisons, as opposed to
                        a quarter by quarter chart,
                        but for context, here are its 2021 Q2 and Q3 mDAU figures side-by-side.
                    </P>
                    <img src="../WEBINAR/pictures/socialmediap2.webp" class="SO2">
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        As you can see, Twitter didn’t add any new users in the US at all, with all 5 million of its
                        new users coming from
                        outside North America. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, as Twitter still has plenty of
                        growth potential in various
                        markets, but it may be a concern for investors, given that the majority of the platform’s
                        revenue is driven by US users.

                    </p>
                    <img src="../WEBINAR/pictures/socialmediap3.webp" class="SO2">
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        Again, Twitter uses a more skewed YoY comparison, as opposed to displaying quarterly
                        performance, but again, for
                        context, Twitter brought in $1.19 billion in revenue in Q2 2021, meaning that it generated an
                        additional $94 million in
                        Q3, with the majority coming from the US.

                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        Any growth is obviously good, but it’s interesting to consider where Twitter’s usage stats are
                        trending with respect to
                        its growth targets, which it announced back in February. As part of its Analyst Day
                        presentation, Twitter noted that it
                        was aiming to reach 315 million mDAU by Q4 2023, with revenue rising to $7.5 billion in that
                        year.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../WEBINAR/pictures/socialmediap4.webp" class="S4">
                    <h2 class="h22">So how is Twitter tracking?</h2>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        Twitter was at 199m mDAU in Q1 this year, rising to 206m in Q2 (+7m), and is now 211m in Q3
                        (+5m). In order to reach
                        315m by 2023, it needs an annual growth rate of around 38.6m mDAU. So right now, it’s not
                        exactly on track, while its
                        revenue numbers will also need a significant boost to get the platform to those marks (Twitter’s
                        on track to reach $5.1b
                        in revenue this year).
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        Which it needs to hit, otherwise it could face significant change. Last year, a group of
                        activist investors bought their
                        way onto Twitter’s board in order to push for the replacement of current CEO Jack Dorsey, who
                        they feel is not
                        maximizing the opportunities of the platform. Twitter’s executive team was able to arrange a
                        stay of execution for
                        Dorsey, based on these ambitious growth targets, but if Twitter can’t meet them, you can bet
                        that those calls for
                        Dorsey’s removal will ramp up once again, which could spark a major shift at the app.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        Which is also why Twitter’s been so keen to try new things, and throw new ideas at the wall,
                        which, in general, has been
                        a welcome change for the app that’s long been criticized for its lack of innovative momentum.
                        But even so, the numbers,
                        at least right now, don’t point to these new additions providing any major usage boost as yet,
                        with many of the projects
                        either falling flat or failing to gain significant take-up in the early going.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sportsp">
                        For example, Twitter shut down its Stories-like Fleets option in July due to lack of user
                        interest, it’s subscription
                        add-on program Twitter Blue hasn’t provided any radical new functionality that would justify the
                        monthly cost, despite
                        Twitter trying to angle ‘undo send’ as an alternative for a tweet editing functionality, and its
                        Communities group
                        tweeting process seems to run counter to a lot of the platform’s key engagement opportunities.
